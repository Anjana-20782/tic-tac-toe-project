##  Project Overview
This project allows a **human player (X)** to compete against the **computer (O)**.  
The computer uses basic logic to play smartly — it tries to win, block your move, or take the best available position.  
All game data (scores and current board) are stored using **LocalStorage**, so even if you refresh the page, your progress remains saved.
